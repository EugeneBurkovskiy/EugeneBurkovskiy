### About me😵
***
I really like to work with value and the feeling that I am doing some useful project gives me the most to keep moving in the same direction. One of my main principles in life is continuous development in the field that I have chosen for myself. Quite unexpectedly for me, having tried programming, I realized how interesting this area is for me, and to be honest, I devote most of my life to this particular field of activity. I want to become a professional and do my job efficiently and effectively.
